                The browser's viewport is area of the window in which web content can be seen. This is often not the same size as the rendered
                page, in which case the browser provides scrollbars for the user to scroll around and access all the content.
            </p>
            <p>
                Narrow screen devices (e.g. mobiles) render pages in a virtual window or viewport, which is usually wider than the screen,
                and then shrink the rendered result down so it can all be seen at once. Users can then pan and zoom to see
                different areas of the page. For example, if a mobile screen has a width of 640px, pages might be rendered
                with a virtual viewport of 980px, and then it will be shrunk down to fit into the 640px space.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is done because many pages are not mobile optimized, and break (or at least look bad) when rendered at a small viewport
                width. This virtual viewport is a way to make non-mobile-optimized sites in general look better on narrow
                screen devices.
            </p>
            <h3 id="viewport-meta">Enter viewport meta tag</h3>
            <p>
                However, this mechanism is not so good for pages that are optimized for narrow screens using
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries">media queries</a> — if the virtual viewport is 980px for example, media queries that kick in at 640px or
                480px or less will never be used, limiting the effectiveness of such responsive design techniques.
            </p>
            <p>
                To mitigate this problem, Apple introduced the "viewport meta tag" in Safari iOS to let web developers control the viewport's
                size and scale. Many other mobile browsers now support this tag, although it is not part of any web standard.
                Apple's documentation does a good job explaining how web developers can use this tag, but we had to do some
                detective work to figure out exactly how to implement it in Fennec. For example, Safari's documentation says
                the content is a "comma-delimited list," but existing browsers and web pages use any mix of commas, semicolons,
                and spaces as separators.

            <h2 id="basics">Viewport basics</h2>

            A typical mobile-optimized site contains something like the following:

            <br>

            <pre>
                    <code class="language-html">&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&gt;</code>
                </pre>

            <p>
                The
                <code>width</code> property controls the size of the viewport. It can be set to a specific number of pixels like
                <code>width=600</code> or to the special value
                <code>device-width</code>, which is the width of the screen in CSS pixels at a scale of 100%. (There are corresponding
                <code>height</code> and
                <code>device-height</code> values, which may be useful for pages with elements that change size or position based on the viewport height.)
            </p>
            <p>
                The
                <code>initial-scale</code> property controls the zoom level when the page is first loaded. The
                <code>maximum-scale</code>,
                <code>minimum-scale</code>, and
                <code>user-scalable</code> properties control how users are allowed to zoom the page in or out.
            </p>

            <h2 id="pixel">A pixel is not a pixel</h2>

            <p>
                In recent years, screen resolutions have risen to the size that individual pixels are hard to distinguish with the human
                eye. For example, recent smartphones generally have a 5-inch screens with resolutions upwards of 1920—1080
                pixels (~400 dpi). Because of this, many browsers can display their pages in a smaller physical size by translating
                multiple hardware pixels for each CSS "pixel". Initially this caused usability and readability problems on
                many touch-optimized web sites. Peter-Paul Koch wrote about this problem in
                <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/04/a_pixel_is_not.html">A pixel is not a pixel</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                On high dpi screens, pages with
                <code>initial-scale=1</code> will effectively be zoomed by browsers. Their text will be smooth and crisp, but their bitmap images will
                probably not take advantage of the full screen resolution. To get sharper images on these screens, web developers
                may want to design images – or whole layouts – at a higher scale than their&nbsp;final size&nbsp;and then
                scale them down using CSS or viewport properties. This is consistent with the
                <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/syndata.html#length-units">CSS 2.1 specification</a>, which says:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    If the pixel density of the output device is very different from that of a typical computer display, the user agent should
                    rescale pixel values. It is recommended that the pixel unit refer to the whole number of device pixels
                    that best approximates the reference pixel. It is recommended that the reference pixel be the visual
                    angle of one pixel on a device with a pixel density of 96dpi and a distance from the reader of an arm's
                    length.
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                For web developers, this means that the size of a page is much smaller than the actual pixel count and browsers may size
                their layouts and images accordingly. But remember that not all mobile devices are the same width; you should
                make sure that your pages work well in a large variation of screen sizes and orientations.
            </p>
            <p>
                The default pixel ratio depends on the display density. On a display with density less than 200dpi, the ratio is 1.0. On
                displays with density between 200 and 300dpi, the ratio is 1.5. For displays with density over 300dpi, the
                ratio is the integer floor(
                <em>density</em>/150dpi). Note that the default ratio is true only when the viewport scale equals 1. Otherwise,
                the relationship between CSS pixels and device pixels depends on the current zoom level.
